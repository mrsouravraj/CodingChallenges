# Build Your Own Spell Checker Using A Bloom Filter
This challenge is to build your own micro spell checker. The goal is to create a spell checker that can determine if a word is probably spelt correctly without having to store the full list of words. Thus the spell checker can use less storage (disk or memory). A task that is much less relevant these days, but 20 years ago was incredibly useful on low storage devices.

Whilst we donâ€™t have this problem with spell checking today, we do have similar problems checking if an item is in a data set that would be too big to store efficiently.

So how are these problems solved? With Bloom filters.

A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure. It is built around a bit array and one or more hash functions. It provides a fast and efficient way of handling set membership queries when the set either does not fit within the memory constraints, or querying the full set would incur a performance penalty.

Bloom filters have been used in:

ðŸ‘‰ Spell checkers - like youâ€™re going to build in this Coding Challenge.

ðŸ‘‰ Network routers - speeding up packet routing protocols amongst other uses.

ðŸ‘‰ Databases - a quick way of determining if if a row is likely to be in the database without performing costly disk lookups. Used in Googleâ€™s Bigtable, Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra and Postgres

ðŸ‘‰ Web crawlers - donâ€™t re-crawl a URL thatâ€™s already been seen.

ðŸ‘‰ Cyber security - blacklisting, whitelisting and password / username checkers

ðŸ‘‰ Web caches - preventing â€˜one hit wondersâ€™ being stored in disk caches for CDNs.

ðŸ‘‰ Cryptocurrency - Speeding up wallet synchronisation and finding logs in the blockchain.

ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation systems - Medium has used Bloom filters to not recommend articles youâ€™ve already seen.
